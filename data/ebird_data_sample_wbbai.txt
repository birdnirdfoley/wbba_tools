OBSERVER NOTES: 7/7/95:I have been bird watching about 12 years.  One day a friend called to tell me she saw a mockingbird in her yard.  She and her husband had been seeing it quite often.  Everytime I went there I didn't see anything.  For some days it kept coming back, all of a sudden it quit coming.  One day she and her husband were walking in their yard, they have a grove of shrubs near their house, all of a sudden this bird flew up in front of them.  They thought it was a mockingbird.  My friend phoned me at once.  My daughter was visiting me, she has also been watching birds, so with book in hand we went to see the bird.  We saw the bird, and nest with three little birds.  We also thought it was a mockingbird.  When we got home we finally sat down with all the bird books and looked up mockingbirds.  The bird we saw was not a mockingbird, so back we went to my friends, with book this time and a notebook and pen.  While there this time I looked at th e bird with the binoculars and my daughter wrote down the information.  I can see where notebooks are very important and I never go without one now.  When we got home, back to the books we went.  This time we were sure it was the black-billed cuckoo.  The next day we went to my friends, she looked at her bird book and we all agreed that it was the Black-billed Cuckoo.  She had 3 young in a nest that was about a foot off the ground.  The nest was in a shrub which overlooks a field, there is a grove of shrubs around it.  We didn't stay around too long as we didn't want to scare the mother bird.  A few days later when we went back they were gone.  I guess I should have watched her to see what some of her habits were, but I was always taught to leave mother and young alone.  Being this was the first time I have seen a different bird with young than a robin, I left them alone.  Being this was my first year doing this (the survey) I should have at a distance watched the birds to see what she was doing.  This year I hope to get a chance to see more birds with young and have the presents to observe more and of course write everything down.

OBSERVER NOTES: 5/29/95:1  young.  I only observed the 2 adults and the fledgling in the same area for about 3 weeks.  I assume the nest was in a small area behind a swamp across from my house.  Plus the pair and young could be heard or seen everyday for three weeks.  They fed in a half mile area.  Swmapland, small creek, beaver pond, fallow grassland.  Deciduous mix.  I was surprised the little guy could get around so well.
